# Demo Recording Checklist

- Ensure Keynote is openable and that Python has Accessibility + Automation permissions.
- Start screen recording (entire display) and ensure the Keynote window is visible.
- In a terminal, activate the project virtualenv and run `make run-client`.
- Capture the full CLI log output and the Keynote window showing the rectangle and text appearing.
- Stop recording only after the client prints `FINAL_ANSWER: [done]` in the log.
- Save the video with a descriptive name (e.g., `demo-keynote-agent.mp4`).
